<p>Come and get your love</p>>
<p>Come and get your love</p>>
<p>Come and get your love</p>>
<p>Come and get your love</p>>

[Verse 1]

What's the matter with your head? Yeah
<p>Hail (Hail)</p>
What's the matter with your mind
And your sign and-a, oh-oh-oh
<p>Hail (Hail)</p>
Nothing the matter with your head, baby, find it
Come on and find it
Hail
With it, baby, 'cause you're fine
And you're mine and you look so divine

[Chorus]
<p>Come and get your love</p>
<p>Come and get your love</p>
<p>Come and get your love</p>
<p>Come and get your love</p>

[Verse 2]
<p>Hail (Hail)</p>
What's the matter with you?
Feel right, don't you feel right, baby?
Hail, oh yeah
Get it from the main vine, alright
I said a-find it, find it
Go on and love it if you like it, yeah
    <p>Hail (Hail) </p>
